     */
    'queries' => [
        /*
         * Except columns in fillable.
         *
         * This `except_columns_in_fillable` must be arrayed!
         * This `except_columns_in_fillable` that remove field from $fillable in model.
         */
        'except_columns_in_fillable' => [
            'id', 'updated_at', 'created_at',
        ],
    ],
